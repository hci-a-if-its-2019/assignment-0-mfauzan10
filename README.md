2.	FANTASY LIGA 1 GOJEK
(https://fantasy.liga-indonesia.id/)

There are some problems that make this site not good enough :

	The ‘transfer’ button on ‘Susun Skuat’ can’t be use everytime. 



		Solution :
This menu should can be use even the current matchday is playing. The new squad players will save for the next match and the old squad players will use in current matchday.

	There is no schedule of Liga 1 Gojek in menu ‘Susun Skuat’



Solution : 
	Schedule of Matchday League should be add on ‘Susun Skuat’ Page. So the players or users can predict the squad that will be choosen (Get high point of fantasy league). 


3.	PERSIB BANDUNG OFFICIAL WEBSITE
(http://www.persib.co.id/)

There are some problems that make this site not good enough :

	If we choose menu ‘Login’ and ‘ Register’, the page will show the same page (main page). And If we click menu ‘Login’ and ‘Register’ more than one time, the error will show on page like picture below :



	The second problem is when we click submenu ‘Persib Q&A’ the page also show the same page (main page)

Solution : 
	We can add the page that suitable for ‘Login’ Page, ‘Register’ Page, and ‘Persib Q&A’ Page, because these pages are important for a website.
